# Preface

This book is aimed at people who want to understand the inner workings of Aqeous OS. It is __NOT__ aimed at those who want to know how to use the OS. The book is divided into deveral parts, and is also a documentation for us the creators. It won't be structured normally, and will linearly proceed through everything that we've built in the order. The current OS version is 0.04a. It's not stable, and anything can break anytime.
